    <h2>Apollo 11 (1969)</h2>
    <p>Apollo 11 launched aboard a Saturn V rocket from Kennedy Space Center on July 16, 1969.
      After a three-day journey, the spacecraft entered lunar orbit on July 19.
      On July 20, Armstrong and Aldrin entered the lunar module, nicknamed Eagle, and separated from the command module, Columbia, which remained in orbit with Collins.
      Eagle landed in the Sea of Tranquility on July 20, 1969, at 20:17:39 UTC. .</p>

    <h2>Hubble Space Telescope (1990–)</h2>
    <p>The Hubble Space Telescope (HST), launched in 1990, revolutionized astronomy by providing unprecedented views of the cosmos, free from the blurring effects of Earth's atmosphere. This collaboration between NASA and ESA has profoundly reshaped our understanding of the universe, from nearby planets to the most distant galaxies..</p>

    <h2>Curiosity Rover (2012–)</h2>
    <p>ASA's Curiosity rover, a key component of the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) mission, launched in 2011 and successfully landed in Gale Crater on Mars in August 2012. The primary objective of the mission is to determine if Mars ever had environmental conditions suitable for supporting microbial life, says NASA Science..</p>

    <h2>James Webb Space Telescope (2021–)</h2>
    <p>The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), launched on December 25, 2021, marks a monumental leap in space exploration, succeeding the Hubble Space Telescope as the premier observatory for the next decade. This international collaboration between NASA, ESA, and the Canadian Space Agency is designed primarily for infrared astronomy, allowing it to peer back in time and through dust clouds in ways previously impossible.</p>

    <h2>Perseverance Rover (2021–)</h2>
    <p>NASA's Perseverance rover, part of the Mars 2020 mission, landed in Jezero Crater on Mars on February 18, 2021. The rover is exploring this ancient lakebed and river delta to seek signs of past microbial life, collect samples for future return to Earth, and prepare for human exploration of the Red Planet. As of July 17, 2025, Perseverance has been active on Mars for 1567 sols (1,610 Earth days)..</p>
